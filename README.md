# 🚗 ESPDrive – Wi-Fi Controlled Motor Car (ESP32)

**ESPDrive** is a real-time motor control system built using an ESP32. It hosts a mobile-friendly web interface that lets you control a car's motion over Wi-Fi — no external app or server required!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Control via browser (desktop/mobile)
- 🔌 ESP32-hosted web UI (no internet needed)
- ⬆️ Real-time actions (press-and-hold based)
- 🧭 Directional controls:
  - Forward / Reverse
  - Left / Right
  - Stop
- 🧠 Built-in mDNS support (use `http://car.local`)

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- ESP32 Dev Board
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- 2 DC Motors (Drive + Steering)
- Jumper wires, battery, chassis
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 board installed

## ⚙️ Wiring & Pins

| Function        | ESP32 Pin |
|----------------|-----------|
| Motor1 IN1     | 27        |
| Motor1 IN2     | 26        |
| Motor2 IN1     | 25        |
| Motor2 IN2     | 33        |

Make sure all motor driver EN pins are powered (e.g. connected to 5V or PWM).

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Update your Wi-Fi credentials in the code:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "YourWiFiName";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";
```

Flash the code to your ESP32 using Arduino IDE.

---

## 🖥️ Web Interface

Access the interface by visiting:

```
http://<ESP_IP>
```

Or use:

```
http://car.local
```

Controls available:

- ⬆️ Forward
- ⬇️ Reverse
- ⬅️ Left
- ➡️ Right
- ⏹️ Stop

Each button uses `onmousedown` and `ontouchstart` for smooth control.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi and hosts a simple web server
2. A mobile-friendly HTML page is served to control movement
3. Pressing buttons triggers ESP32 endpoints (`/forward`, `/stop`, etc.)
4. These toggle motor pins in real time to control the car
